Header Section
Create a header section containing the logo of the
travel booking website and a navigation menu with links to different
sections of the website (e.g., Home, Destinations, About Us, Contact).
Ensure the navigation menu is responsive and adjusts its layout for
smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices).
